Develop an app that allows a user to see the list of receipts and add the ability to remove them. 
Fork this repo and keep it public until the review has been completed.

Android: Java/Kotlin Fetch 
Fetch users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
Fetch receipts from http://www.mocky.io/v2/5b648e472e000067004140d9?userid=1
Receipts should be persisted locally and act on them only local. 
The app has to allow the switching users.

Evaluation: 
- App operates as asked 
- No crashes or bugs 
- SOLID principles 
- Code is understandable and maintainable 
- Write at last one class coverage test you think is interesting to test.
- If you could use any new architecture like mvvp will be a bonus.

Hints: Let's switch the user by the dropdown view. 
To select rows to delete use the gmail UX
