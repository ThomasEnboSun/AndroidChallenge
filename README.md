# AndroidChallenge


Develop an app that allows a user to see the list of receipts and be able to select and delete. 
Fork this repo and keep it public until the review has been completed.

Use Java or Kotlin 

Fetch users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Fetch receipts from http://www.mocky.io/v2/5b648e472e000067004140d9?userid=1

Receipts should be persisted locally and the deletion is local only.

The app has to allow switching users.

Evaluation: 
- App operates as asked.
- No crashes or bugs. 
- SOLID principles. 
- Code is understandable and maintainable.
- Write at last one test for a class that you think is interesting to test.
- [BONUS] use a mvvm architecture.

Hints: 
- Switch the user by the dropdown view. 
- Use the gmail list as UX reference with selectable rows to proceed with the deletion.
